                  Since 1991, Hamro Pustakalaya has existed as a tiny island of
                  peace in a fast-moving world. Thriving and growing every year,
                  the business that started from a post-card board selling
                  postcards to tourists in the heart of Lakeside has grown to be
                  one of the hidden Jewels of Pokhara with floor-to-ceiling
                  stacks of books and a generally inclusive vibe that makes it
                  seem like a neighborhood spot for anyone and everyone. It now
                  has one of the largest collection of books in Nepal and is a
                  place you can easily get lost in. The shelves are filled with
                  books you might have a hard time finding anywhere else in
                  Nepal- the bookstore holds around 1 million books in stock and
                  is a wholesale distributor as well.

                  In a time when we sleep with our smartphones next to us and
                  stare into our computer screens all day, what you share on
                  social media tells a story about who you are and many canâ€™t
                  resist telling a story about themselves as smart, worldly, and
                  well-read. While the concept started with #bookstagramming the
                  lofty collection at the book shop, Hamro Pustakalya has come a
                  long way and is aiming create the largest community of book
                  readers in Nepal. Through Hamro Pustakalya, you can have
                  multiple Universes at your doorsteps, no kidding! But it's
                  more than just an online bookstore. We are also aiming to
                  connect authors to their readers in a different way, a better
                  way and we hope to inspire a reading culture in Nepal. We
                  think we can make reading cool again- and now that the world
                  of reading has moved to digital, we think we're going in a
                  good direction.
